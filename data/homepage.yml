  #    text: "Presented to the public as part of the Systemware Plus! initiative, \"Watercolor\" appears to be a side \"persona\" of Whistler. This persona appears to write far more obscene content, and though Systemware does not endorse its creations, they are still available for the public's interest as a part of our preservation efforts."
